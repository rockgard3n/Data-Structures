# A deepdive into Data Structures
This Repo holds my work in investigating and learning about various data structures and their respective advantages and disadvantages. I've included 5 projects I worked through that demonstrate my progress nicely. 

I leaned on "Data Structures & Algorithms in Python" by Micheal T Goodrich along with various resources online. 

In each of the listed projects I included an indepth explanation of how performance is impacted by the Data Structures utilized. I also include explanations of the test cases I wrote.

## Balanced Binary Search Tree
Created a new balanced BST class to demonstrate and learn the benefits of Binary Search Trees 

## Unbalanced Binary Search Tree
Created an unablanced BST class

## Usecases for Deque
Created a Deque class and then leveraged it to create a variety of other classes which I then used to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem and create a Delimiter Checking program. 

## Josephus
Created a Linked List class to solve the Josephus problem. Thanks to the Linked List class the algorithm was very simple. 

## Selection vs Insertion Sort
An investigation of Big O for different types of sorting methods
